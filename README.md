# Phishing URL Detection System

This project detects whether a URL is phishing or legitimate using Machine Learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset contains URL-based features such as:
- URL length
- HTTPS usage
- Domain age
- Web traffic
- Redirect behavior
- Google index
- DNS record

## Models Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Workflow
1. Load dataset
2. Data preprocessing
3. Train-test split
4. Model training
5. Performance evaluation

## Results
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy among the models.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
